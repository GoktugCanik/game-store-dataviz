Interactive Streamlit app for exploring a game store dataset with Plotly visualizations. Includes filters (tags, developers, OS, languages, year, free-only) and advanced charts (bar, treemap, sunburst, parallel coordinates, scatter/bubble, box, line, sankey, correlation heatmap, network, swarm, radar, marimekko, 3D scatter, density heatmap, icicle). Optimized for responsiveness by limiting heavy charts to the top 50 records.
